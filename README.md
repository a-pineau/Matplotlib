# Matplotlib
Some example of plotting methods are given in this repository:
- a single and simple plot (single_plot.py)
- a more advanced plot with annotations and multiple sets of data (multiple_plot_same_axes.py)
- different plots in a squared grid (square_single_plot.py)
- a single barplot (single_barplot.py)
- multiple barplots with advanced features (multiple_barplot.py)
- some pie charts (pie_chart.py)
- a pcolormesh (pcolormesh.py)

A plot helper (plot_helper.py) can be imported as a module to ease plot production (still a lot TODO)
A sandbox (sandbox_plot.py) provides tests using the plot helper as a module
